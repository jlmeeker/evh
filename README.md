Event Horizon (EVH) is a Web-based application which facilitates the secure transfer of files. Originally designed to replace FTP transfers, EVH currently allows uploads via HTTP and can also handle files uploaded via FTP. All file uploads are assigned an expiration period, after which the file is permanently removed from the system. This allows for automatic cleanup as well, keeping the underlying filesystem in tip-top shape.
