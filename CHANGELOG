1.1.0
	- Initial GPL v3 release
1.1.5
	- find_ftp_file function changed to use awk instead of cut.  This 
		should make ftp uploads more reliable
	- version info is now displayed in page footers
	- disclaimer can be disabled in the footer now by setting $showdisclaimer = FALSE
	- footer banner/image not displayed if $banner is NULL or empty (which is the default)
	- split up inc.php into functions.php and inc.php.  functions.php now holds constants 
		and functions only.  inc.php only contains default variable values
	- inc.php now includes inc.php.local.  It is recommended that inc.php be copied to 
		inc.php.local and all values changed there.  inc.php.local will not be over-
		written upon release updates (won't be included in the tar/zip packages)
	- admin page was updated to include the total number of files and disk space used
	- INSTALL file was updated to reflect the changes above (mainly inc.php.local)
1.1.6
	- Added option to inc.php for recording transfer (including modification) history ($savehistory)
		Only logs source IP, fileid, sessionid, and browser info (not for downloads yet)
	- Added option to inc.php for showing logging disclaimer in footer ($discloselogging)
	- Modified eventhorizon.sql to reflect new History table
	- Added update-1.1.6.sql to the fileset.  This is for upgrading from pre-1.1.6 to 1.1.6.
		It only creates the history table
	- Modified functions.php to include additional footer text if $discloselogging = TRUE
	- Modified en.inc language file to include $historyfootertext for showing in the footer
	- FUTURE: with logging capabilities, we could decrease error log messages some
1.1.7
	- Added option to inc.php for setting company name ($companyname).  Now we don't have to
		worry about overwriting lang/en.inc on subsequent updates
	- Created new function in functions.php to perform History table inserts (modified pertinent
		pages to use this new function)
	- Modified History table: dropped sessid and fileid since they'd be useless anyway, and added
		filename, srcemail, dstemail
	- Added a view history page (linked from admin index)
	- Fixed minor bug in title menu (it had an extra "upload" link which shouldn't be visible unless
		FTP uploads are disabled)
1.1.8
	- Added logging to cleanup scripts so files deleted upon expiration are logged too
	- Replaced javascript which queried browser information to use $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] instead (now we can log
		browser information for ALL transactions)
	- Replaced history insert code in purge.php with new function (missed this one first time around)
	- Removed superfluous $domains entry from uploadfiles.php (this was supersceding the value 
		set in inc.php.local
	- Added History filtering/searching as well as column choices
	- Minor code cleanup
1.1.9
	- Slightly modified the recipient emails to have a more user-friendly URL and 
		instructions for downloading if the URL doesn't work
1.1.9a
	- Fixed SQL injection vulnerabilities in multiple files.  This brings the app into PCI compliance
1.1.10
	- Added configuration file directive to say whether or not the site is SSL enabled.
	- Changed links to reflect whether or not site is SSL enabled (default to https if possible).
	- Fixed various and sundry embedded "TNI" and replaced with $companyname
	- Fixed incomplete download page with invalid download code
